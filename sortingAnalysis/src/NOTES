things to consider:
1. what data types for what data sets.
    -arraylist for real data due to unknown size? much less memory efficient
    -arrays for synthetic data? manual operations and runtimes slightly harder to track
2. where will we keep track of runtimes
    -inside experiment method? run-times will be slightly off due to calling sorting methods while timer runs
    -inside sorting methods? more accurate run times but messier to manage and makes re-using methods annoying if we dont want to tabulate data
3. input and output
    -input and output through files? easier to automate but file-io sucks ass in java
    -command line? harder to automate but easier to manage and also sucks ass in java
