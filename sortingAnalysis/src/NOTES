things to consider:
1. what data types for what data sets.
    -arraylist? easier to use with unknown data size (like real data) but much less memory efficient
    -arrays? easier to control memory usage but difficult to work with unknown data size
2. where will we keep track of runtimes
    -inside experiment method? run-times will be slightly off due to calling sorting methods while timer runs
    -inside sorting methods? more accurate run times but messier to manage and makes re-using methods annoying if we dont want to tabulate data
3. input and output
    -input and output through files? easier to automate but file-io sucks ass in java
    -command line? harder to automate but easier to manage and also sucks ass in java
4. copying data
    -copy data before each sort? twice the memory usage but more efficient time-wise
    -reconstruct data before each usage? less efficient time-wise but less memory usage
5. what type of data
    -one data type (i.e. ints)? only need to implement one sort method
    -multiple data types? need multiple sorting methods but more robust data in the end
